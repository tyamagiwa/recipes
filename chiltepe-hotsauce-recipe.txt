Chiltepe Hot Sauce

Ingredients:
⅓ cup chiltepe chilies
1 small white onion
1 cup fresh cilantro
1 roma tomato
1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
1 lime, plus more to taste

Procedure:

Remove the stem from all the chilies.
Bring a small pot of water to a boil, enough to cover the chilies.
Add the chilies to the boiling water, and let them cook for about 2-3 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely chop the onion, tomato, and cilantro.
When the 2-3 minutes are up, remove the chilies from the water with a slotted spoon, and transfer them to a bowl. Do not discard the water.
Press the chilies with a fork, or the back of a spoon and mix in the chopped onion, cilantro and tomato. Add ¼ cup of the reserved water and season with the teaspoon of salt and the juice of one lime. Taste, and adjust seasoning to your liking.
Mix well and refrigerate
